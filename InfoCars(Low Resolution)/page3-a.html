            Toyota has launched the 2nd generation of Fortuner in Pakistan considering the spike of sales of new
            generation in other countries. The new Toyota Fortuner 2020 encompasses an aggressive body tone which
            complements the size of SUV. Toyota Fortuner has 2 variants in Pakistan,Toyota Fortuner 2.7 VVTi and Toyota
            Fortuner 2.8 Sigma 4. Few changes were made in Toyota Fortuner 2.7 VVTi (petrol variant) in 2020 Push Start
            Button, smart entry, vehicle stability control, emergency brake signal and light reminder were
            introduced.The Toyota Fortuner 2020 price in Pakistan is between PKR 7,699,000 To 9,149,000.

            The exterior dimensions of the 2nd generation of Toyota Fortuner is aesthetically revamped. The head lights
            of the vehicle have LED lights in them which further adds to the beauty of the car. The rear lights are much
            like the latest LX570, stretched and aggressive. The latest 7 seater Toyota Fortuner has hydraulic trunk and
            bonnet. These hydraulic features are a blessing in SUV’s as they are very heavy and it gets difficult to
            hold them. Both the front and rear bumpers are large enough with bulbs installed in them. It is a common
            trend to see large bumpers these days as it not only reduces the weight of the vehicle but also helps in
            better acceleration. Toyota Indus launched the diesel variant in 2020 and they installed LED foglamps in
            diesel variant contrary to existing petrol variant having halogen fog lamps. Toyota also installed the power
            back door and silver side step in Toyota Fortuner 2020.
